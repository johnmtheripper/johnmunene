 - Part of the reason, maybe the reason,I got into tech was video games. 
 I probably wouldn't have started programming if it wasn't for video games or wouldn't have gotten interested in computers or tech if it wasn't for video games. I strongly believe video games are a powerful force for getting people Interested in technology; it has a way bigger knock-on effects than people may realize
